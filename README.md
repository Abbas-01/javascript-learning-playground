# JavaScript Learning Playground

Welcome to my JavaScript Learning Playground repository! This is a space for me to practice and explore JavaScript concepts, experiment with code, and document my learning journey.

## About

This repository contains a collection of JavaScript projects, exercises, and code snippets covering various topics such as:
- Basic syntax and language features
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- Asynchronous programming (callbacks, promises, async/await)
- ES6 features (arrow functions, destructuring, spread/rest operators, etc.)
- and more!

Feel free to explore the projects and exercises to learn along with me or use them as a reference for your own learning journey.
